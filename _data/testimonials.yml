  testimonial: "Rushabh joined me as a Research Assistant in January'16. I supervised him for project, 'A Novel Computer Aided Diagnosis System for Breast Cancer Based on Reinforcement Sample Learning Strategy for Convolution Neural Network', 'Big Data Analytics on SIU hospital data' and 'Edge detection using convolution neural network'. Rushabh presented outstanding commitment to his studies, and finished his degree within the top 1% of his class. He is a quite remarkable student with a strong research interest. Among his peers, he stood out by always being up-to-date with currently topical discussions even within niches of this research.

  testimonial: "I had Rushabh in my CSC570 Big Data Analytics class in FALL 2016 and he was, without doubt, at the top 1% of class. Rushabh is very professional, smart, reliable, dedicated, and a creative thinker. The solutions he submitted for many of the class projects exceeded my expectations and demonstrated his ability to learn and think critically. He even did all the optional and challenge projects in the course. As final project for Big Data Analytics class, Rushabh built an analyzed the ACM citation graph with Spark and Hadoop. I was very impressed with Rushabh's performance in class and I am currently collaborating with him on a research project I am conducting with SIU School of Medicine on analyzing pediatric big data to discover pediatric population that are more at risk for certain diseases in Southern Illinois Region. Rushabh will also assisted me on a workshop on Twitter Graph Analysis we presented in March 2017 at Cyber Defense and Disaster Recovery Conference at UIS. Rushabh is also modest about his abilities and is a very pleasant person to work and interact with. Rushabh is very reliable and persistent. I have no doubt that Rushabh will be a great addition to any company who is willing to give him a chance as an international student."

  testimonial: "I met Rushabh in the spring of 2016 while he was a master's student in computer science at UIS. At the time, two colleagues and I were looking for a research assistant to work with us on a university-funded research project. Rushabh applied for the position. None of us knew him because he came from another department but we were impressed not only with his technical knowledge and skills, which surpassed the other applicants, but also with his communication abilities, pleasant personality and self-confidence. He got the job. My 3-month collaboration with Rushabh during the summer of 2016 confirmed my initial impressions. Rushabh worked with us on data collection and coding for a meta-analytic study of supply chain integration. He parsed through hundreds of papers, identified the relevant papers and collected from them the effect sizes to include in our dataset. As a computer science major, Rushabh did not initially know much about supply chain management. But he learned very quickly. It was a pleasure to work with him. He understood what needed to be done, worked very hard, and completed his part of the project in the limited time that we had. It is an honor to recommend him."
